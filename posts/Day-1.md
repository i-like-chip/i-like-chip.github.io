Made a hollow box using 2 cubes and a difference Boolean modifier.
Used the same method to create a hole using a cylinder.
Ended up remaking the box using planes so I could remove walls and ceiling for easier access.
This will become a room on a spaceship, with animated window view, screens, and holograms.
