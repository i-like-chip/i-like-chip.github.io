To learn how to make some more complex shapes, so I can start making assets for the scene, I decided to watch another of Joey Carlino's videos. His video [‘Modelling in Blender for complete beginners,’](https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VmXzjgWQEg) had some techniques which me helped get started.

Here's what I did:

* Used a torus to make a window frame, then sculpted a window seat from a cube by moving vertices and edges in edit mode, and using the extrude function.

* Made a vent with realistic slots by using the difference Boolean modifier.

* Made a planter for the Monstera using a cube, and sculpted it in the same fashion as before.

* Added a plane for the soil, a plain for the lights, and a couple of vents.  

* Played around with panel lighting, and made the planter light plane glow by changing the surface to ‘Emission’ and turning up the strength.

It's starting to look a bit more realistic with detailed textures on the walls, floor, and ceiling.
