Watched some of Joey Carlino’s
video [‘Modelling in Blender for
complete beginners,’](https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VmXzjgWQEg) to learn how
to make more complex shapes.    


#### Here's what I made:

Used a torus to make a window frame, then sculpted a window seat from a cube.

Created a planter for the Monstera using a cube. Added a plane for the soil, and a plain for the lights.
Created a vent with realistic slots by using the difference Boolean modifier. Added vents to both the planter and seat. Played around with panel lighting, and made the planter light plane glow by changing the Surface to ‘Emission’ and turning up the strength.

Starting to look more realistic with detailed textures on the walls, floor, and ceiling
