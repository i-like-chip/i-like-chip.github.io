I decided it would be a good idea to follow along with a tutorial to help me get to grips with Blender and start learning some shortcuts and workflows. I chose Joey Carlino’s video ‘Getting started - Blender for complete beginners’ and followed along while making the scene in the video.

Here is what I made:

Joey's videos are really good. Everything is explained very well, and button presses are annouced vocally and shwon visually on the screen which was a big help. I'm very pleased with the end result, and making this scene increased my skill as well as my confidence.
