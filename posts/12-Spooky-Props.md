My partner requested some spooky props for her vampire halloween costume and our flat. Most of these are remixes from designs I found on Thingiverse, you can find the files through my Thingiverse link.

#### Ghost

This ghost I made in Blender using a free .svg file a found. I made it so that I could print in 2 colours - manually changing filament at a set point in the print. This is a method I used in a few of these prints. In Blender I extruded the silhouette of the ghost, then extruded elements of the .svg and layered them on top to add the details - these will be printed in the second colour. For this ghost I used glow in the dark filament for the main colour, and black as the accent colour printed on top.

#### Skull Earrings

I collaborated with my partner to make these earrings, as she is really good at making jewellery. The skull was originally life size, so I scaled it down and made it more solid by adding some shapes to fill the space. I made the base flat so that it would print easily, then re-meshed to smooth everything out. My partner then made the chains and turned the skulls into earrings.

#### Horns

I edited these horns so that I could use small cable ties to attached them to a discreet hair band. I made grooves so that they would sit flat on the wearer's head, and made holes for the cable ties - big enough for the ends of the cable ties to be tucked inside.

#### Bats

I edited the design of these bats so that I could print them in 2 colours. I also added a loop on the back so the bats could be threaded onto the belt string of a satin gown. I tried to give the bats little fangs but they were to small to have the shape I wanted - they came out a bit blobby.

#### Skull Brooch

I edited this brooch to have a flat back for better printing, and so that I could glue a magnet on the back. This allowed it to stick to the metal clasp on the front of my partners corset. Again I printed it in 2 colours to contrast the skull against the ornate shapes behind it. I edited the front teeth to make the fangs more prominent, and did the colour change on the layer that made it look like the skull has horns.
