Made a sci-fi style wall with support columns, panelling, and integrated desk. Mapped the textures to the surfaces by adjusting the mapping node in the shader window. Individual faces can be selected in Edit mode and have different textures applied to them.

Downloaded a desk chair and sofa using BlenderKit. Adjusted the colour of the sofa by adding in a ‘Color Ramp’ node to the knitted fabric texture
