Followed along with Joey Carlino’s
video ‘Getting started - Blender for
complete beginners’ and made this
scene.

Learned how to navigate Blender,
how to make simple shapes, and
use some useful tools.
Arranged the scene, placed the
camera and lights, rendered the
image.
Very pleased with the end result.
