Created a plane and changed the
colour to ‘Image texture’ before
selecting the video made earlier.

Changed the surface to ‘Emission’
to prevent light reflecting off the
video surface. Placed the plane
outside the ‘window’ of the box.

#### Blenderkit and Lighting

Downloaded BlenderKit and placed
a rug and plant in the scene, then
played around with lighting and
colours.
