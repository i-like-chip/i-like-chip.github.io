## Sci-Fi Wall

To give the room more shape I decided to make a sci-fi style wall with support columns, panelling, and integrated desk. To begin with I made a support column, then I duplicated it and re-shaped it into a panel piece, then duplicated that and made a panel piece with a different shape. I used these pieces to start building the wall, and modelled the desk to fit between the support columns.

I learned how to map textures onto surfaces by adjusting the mapping node in the shader window. Individual faces can be selected in Edit mode and have different textures applied to them.

The image below shows some of the faces in the middle of the column arn't quite working with the applied texture, the lines would look better running vertically.

Here you can see I've selected those faces, applied a duplicate of the texture, and rotated it 90° in this case the z-axis.

## Seating

I added some comfort to the space:

* Made some cushions for the seat and textured them with orange fabric.

* Downloaded a desk chair and sofa using BlenderKit.
* Adjusted the colour of the sofa by adding in a ‘Color Ramp’ node to the knitted fabric texture.
