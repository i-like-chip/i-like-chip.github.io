With the main elements of the room sketched out it was time to make it feel lived-in. I curated some items found on Blenderkit and placed them in the scene:

![under desk](./images/day-8-under-desk.png)

![containers](./images/day-8-containers.png)

![reading corner](./images/day-8-reading-corner-shadow-fix.png)

![full scene](./images/day-8-full-scene.png)

I'd like to animate the screens, some of the various LEDs in the scene, steam from the coffee mug, and perhaps some water vapour coming from vents by the plants.
