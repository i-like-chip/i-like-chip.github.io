I decided to make a scene in Blender, with the intention of making an ambient video for a YouTube channel of that genre.  I chose Blender as it is powerful software for digital art like this, making animations, assets for video games, and design for 3D printing, all of which I am interested in exploring further.

Here's what I did on day 1:  

Made a hollow box using 2 cuboids and a difference Boolean modifier.  
Used the same method to create a hole using a cylinder.

I ended up remaking the box using planes so I could remove individual walls and the ceiling for easier access to the interior. The planes form the walls, floor, and ceiling of a room on a spaceship.
