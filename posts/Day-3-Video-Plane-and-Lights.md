### Video on a Plane

Now that I have some video of stars, I wanted to figure out how to position the video in the scene. I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssnJ8yewQ2A&t=2s) video by TLDStudios to be helpful.  

Here's what I did:  

* Created a plane and changed the colour to ‘Image texture’ before selecting one of the videos made earlier.

* Changed the surface to ‘Emission’ to prevent light reflecting off the video surface. Placed the plane outside the ‘window’ of the box.

### Blenderkit and Lighting

I downloaded BlenderKit and placed a rug and plant in the scene, then played around with lighting and colours.
