#### Crystal Ball Nebula

I wanted to create the feeling of moving through space, like looking out a side window of a spaceship. I decided to try and achieve this by rotating a square image of the [Crystal Ball Nebula](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/wise-image-reveals-strange-specimen-in-starry-sea/#carousel-4cca880b-e47b-4039-af7b-fc3bb27c303f-3) by NASA, and zooming in so the viewport traces a circle around the nebula, resulting in a complete loop and thus a looping video.

To highlight this I've un-linked the image file so what's visible of it appears as a pink rectangle, the white square is the outline of the square image:

I made the animation length 8640 frames i.e 6mins, and set keyframes on the rotation transform:

Here's the reuslt as a 15s .gif at 24fps:

The image used was 2618x2618 pixels, so I would need a much bigger image to produce a video with good resoluion at 4k.

#### Stephan's Quintet
The process was repeated with a very high resolution image (12654x12132pixels) from the James Webb telescope, of [Stephan's Quintet](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/034/01G7DA5ADA2WDSK1JJPQ0PTG4A).

The resolution is much better with this image, however, the rotation can still be felt, and therefore isn't giving the feeling of smooth linear travel. The big light flares from some of the stars are cool but they break immersion.
