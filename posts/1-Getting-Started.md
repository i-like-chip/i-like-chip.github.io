I decided to make a sc-fi scene in Blender, the idea is to make it in the style of an ambient video like you'll find on YouTube. I find I learn best when I come up with something to make, then figure out how to make it. I chose Blender as it is powerful software for digital art, animation, assets for video games, and design for 3D printing, all of which I am interested in exploring.


It's not pretty yet, but but here's what I did on Day 1 in Blender:  

* Made a hollow box using 2 cuboids and a difference Boolean modifier.  
* Used the same method to create a hole using a cylinder.

I ended up remaking the box using planes so I could remove individual walls and the ceiling for easier access to the interior. The planes form the walls, floor, and ceiling of a room on a spaceship.
