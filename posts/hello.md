## Welcome to 'i like chip', a blog about design for digital art and 3D printing.

This is my personal portfolio where I document my journey learning Blender, and my exploration of 3D printing. You'll find a mix of projects which showcase the creative process and technical steps as I build my skills, along with completed designs that I've brought to life through 3D printing.

I have a back log of projects to post about as I'm currently designing a HUGE Voron 2.4 with 600x600x300mm build volume!

### Highlights

This is Amby, a character I designed in holographic form:

This is a spaceship scene I made with animated stars:

Thanks for checking out my website,
