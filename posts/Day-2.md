Using the video editor, I used the
rotation function to spin a hi-res
image of space 360Â° over 6 mins.
This resulted in a feeling of moving
through space, like looking out a
side window of a spaceship.

I repeated the process with a very
high resolution image from the
James Webb telescope.

I think I'll get better results another way, but these videos were a good test and will be useful placeholders.
